Hint: When testing, connect black common to USB connector or an AUX ground pin.

# Motors:

The motors are 1.8 degrees and rated at 1.2A 12V

- DRV8825: Imax = 2 * Vref   (which means if Imax = 1.5A, then Vref is to be set to 1.5/2 V = 0.75V)
- A4988:   Imax = 2.5 * Vref // with Rcs = 0,05 Ohm

## A4988

- STEPS: `{ 80, 80, 4000, 90 }`

### DRV8825

- 80% power - 0.475 Vref  -- was this but might be causing issues
- 83% power - 0.500 Vref
- 92% power - 0.550 Vref  -- 2019.12.16 using this
- 96% power - 0.575 Vref
- 100% power - 0.600

- STEPS: `{ 160, 160, 8000, 196 }`

Find out the Vref location on the breakout board - Pololu comes with two
locations: a via close to the chip and the center point of the potentiometer;
clones mostly only provide the center point of the potentiometer

# Optical Endstops

Adding in cheap endstops from amazon (middle picture at) 
<http://marlinfw.org/docs/hardware/endstops.html> the end-stops need
to no longer invert the signal since NC (safety feature) works.

Reminder:

- "V" is Volt (+) and connects to RAMPS "+"
- "G" is Ground (=) and connects to RAMPS "-"
- "S" is Singal (-) and connects to RAMPS "S"

**Tuning**

The default Marlin M303 calculates a set of Ziegler-Nichols "Classic"
parameters based on the Ku (Ultimate Gain) and the Pu (Ultimate Period), where
the Ku and Pu are determined by searching for a biased BANG-BANG oscillation
around an average power level that produces oscillations centered on the
setpoint. 

In general a PID circuit will typically overshoot the SP value slightly and
then quickly damp out to reach the SP value.

## manual tuning:

* To tune your PID controller manually, first the integral
  and derivative gains are set to zero. 
* Increase the proportional gain until you observe oscillation in the output. 
  Your proportional gain should then be set to roughly half this value. 
* Increase the integral gain until any offset is corrected for on a time scale
  appropriate for your system.  If you increase this gain too much, you will
  observe significant overshoot of the SP value and instability in the circuit. 
* Derivative gain can then be increased. Derivative gain will
  reduce overshoot and damp the system quickly to the SP value. If you increase
  the derivative gain too much, you will see large overshoot (due to the
  circuit being too slow to respond). 

## Ziegler-Nochols

The Ziegler-Nichols method for PID tuning offers a bit more structured guide to
setting PID values. Again, youâ€™ll want to set the integral and derivative gain
to zero. Increase the proportional gain until the circuit starts to oscillate.
We will call this gain level Ku. The oscillation will have a period of Pu.
Gains are for various control circuits are then given below in the chart.

| Control Type  | Kp         | Ki              | Kd            |
| ---           | ---        | ---             | ---           | 
| P             | $0.50 K_u$ | -               | -             |
| PI            | $0.45 K_u$ | $1.2 K_p / P_u$ | -             |
| PID           | $0.60 K_u$ | $2   K_p / P_u$ | $K_p P_u / 8$ |
